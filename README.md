# Simone Green SEI-Project 1-Rubber Man

## Game Description 

Try this classic game of Hangman with a Twist! Inspired by One Piece, Rubber Man challenges users to test how well they know Luffy. With 5 tries, guess the word and see who or what is uncovered. Be sure to guess wisely! You don't want to make Luffy angry.

The main goal of the game is to guess the correct word. If the word is guessed before the player runs out of tries, they win! Otherwise, they will see images of 'Angry Luffy' with each incorrect guess. It is simple and fun!

    Additional rounds of the game with categories to choose from
    Display hints assoicated with each word
    Functionality to reset the game
